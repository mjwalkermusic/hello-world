////// Introduction

Hey friends!

My name is Michael- I used to tour full-time with my band.

Here's a music video for one of our songs that just hit 1 million views: https://youtu.be/KdKu_J5ebMg

Now that I'm married and want to start a family soon, I've been settling down with my wife in Orlando, FL.

I'm VERY new to the coding world, but I've always been interested, and I decided to get my feet wet by creating a membership/community app for my followers.

////// My App Goals

Long-term, what I'd really like to do is create an ecosystem for my fans with a currency called "Star Coins."

They can earn these coins through participating in community events, sharing my music, and other activities.

When they earn enough coins, they can go to the "Star Store" to trade them in for special rewards, like backstage tickets,  exclusive merchandise, and VIP status.

I have 3 different free-premium tiers for users – The Rays, The Moons, and The Stars.

////// My App Features

Here are a list of features I'd like to include in the basic app:
